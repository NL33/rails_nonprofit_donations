This Rails app demonstrates basic functionality for accepting payments through using the Stripe API. It includes code for accepting payments from a user that will go directly into the Stripe account of the person who set up the payments system. It also includes some basic setup (just skeletal code) for subscription payments--the next step in subscriptions would be to implement the Stripe API for plans.
